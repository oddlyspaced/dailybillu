Python3 Script to fetch a random cat video from Youtube and send it via email.

Using `cron` or any automater tool this script can be automated to work as a newsletter.

Sample Email :

![Sample Mail](https://github.com/oddlyspaced/dailybillu/raw/main/.assets/ss.png)

### Usage
Clone the directory, and rename the sampleconfig.py to config.py, and edit the file parameters accordingly.
Once done, just run billu.py and it would do everything on it's own. /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\

Do note that the script terminates after running 1 job, so in order to send mails at different instances, the script needs to be run accordingly.

### Technologies Used
